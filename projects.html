                <h4>Requirement Analysis: Prototype TM competition platform</h4>
                <p>
                    During the projectweek for Requirement Analysis and PHP, we got the task to make a competition platform for Thomas More.
                    Since we got only one week to work on it, we only needed to do the basics to start the project. This included making the following: a use case diagram, a data model and prototypes for the entire system.
                    <br>
                    <br>I mainly focused on making the prototypes and I also helped with making the use case diagram.
                    It think it was a nice project to work on. I enjoyed making the prototypes, and I'm happy with the result we got as a group.
                    <br>
                    <br>For this semester I hope we can turn the prototype in a fully functioning system. And I'm already looking forward to work with PHP.

                <h4>DevOps & Security: C# recipe organizer </h4>
                <p>
                    For DevOps & Security we got to choose our own project. I choose to design a recipe organizer using C# and Windows Forms.
                    <br> <br>
                    The application utilizes SQLite for local recipe storage, and I implemented the CRUD (Create, Read,
                    Update, Delete) principles to manage recipe data. To facilitate database interactions, I employed the
                    Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool Dapper. Additionally, I incorporated inheritance in the design,
                    introducing a parent class named "Recipe" and a child class named "AdvancedRecipe." This
                    inheritance structure allows for a hierarchical organization of recipe data within the application.
                    <br> <br>
                    Through self-study, I gained valuable insights, in how to utilize databases with C# and Windows Forms. This skill is particularly important since the majority of modern applications rely on databases for their functionality.

                <h4>Data Visualisation: wildlife strikes</h4>
                <p>
                    For the Data Visualization course project, we focused on wildlife strikes in aviation, aiming to inform people using various types of graphs, buttons and images.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The project consists of four pages, each addressing specific questions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What kind of damage does this cause?</li>
                        <li>Are there any weather correlations?</li>
                        <li>Where and when does it happen?</li>
                        <li>Which species causes these incidents?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    I found this project very interesting to work on. I gained more insight on how to visualise data by using different kind of graphs. Moreover, it taught me the art of storytelling through the interpretation of data and graphs.
